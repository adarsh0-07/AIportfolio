# ***AI/ML Projects***


1. ***Image Detection:***
- *Used the ImageNet subset of Images named Stanford’s Dogs Dataset to build a classifier to classify Images with their appropriate tags.*
- *Built a CNN model to predict the label i.e., the name of the Dog breed for a particular image.*
  
2. ***Recommender Systems using MovieLens data***
- *Using the MovieLens dataset of 100,000 ratings arising from 943 users and 1682 movies and cleaning the data to include users who have rated at least 20 movies, the project aimed at the evaluation of performance of different approaches like User K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Item KNN for predicting ratings.*

3. ***Sentiment Analysis Using Yelp Data***
- *Considering 3 dictionaries: the Harvard IV dictionary of positive and negative terms, the extended sentiment lexicon developed by Prof Bing Liu of UIC-CS, and the AFINN dictionary which includes words commonly used in user-generated content in the web. I examined the effectiveness of different sentiment.*
- *Considering reviews for restaurants, predicted 70.82% accurate sentiment polarity (positive/negative) by evaluating various classification models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines).*
  
4. ***Siamese Networks:***
- *Built Sequence Models with Twin Network Architecture.*
- *Used kaggle quora questions dataset to identify duplicate questions*

5. ***Topic Modeling:***
- *Used Kaggle dataset (size ~ 2.0GB) of Stack over Flow questions for Topic Mining*
- *Used pyspark framework to create RDD’s and preprocessed them.*
- *Used Bag of words model approach to preprocess the data and ran TF-IDF to get top words.*
- *Used pyspark.mlib library to implement LDA algorithm to cluster the data into 5 Topics.*
